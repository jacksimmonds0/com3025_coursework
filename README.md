## Required files
In order to be able to compile the code, two external files will need to be acquired from the following links:
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Electronics.json.gz
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/meta_Electronics.json.gz

These two files must be imported into the input folder.

## Running the code
In order to run the code it is preferable to be in a virtual environment i.e.
```
source activate Labs_Env
python pre_processing.py
```
You can also access Jupyter Notebook through the command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
